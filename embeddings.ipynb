Spacek can turn any role into gold; unfortunately, her costars can't. || ... it once in a while just to remember the fun I had I was an extra in this movie so I watch it once in a while just to remember the fun I had. || Three for the price of 1 I 've seen 2 of the 3 films & loved them both.  Sissy Spacek can hold her own among the best of the best.  I would have to say that Night Mother is my favorite.  Suicide is such a delicate subject but they brought it across w/o a hitch.  This is a true portrayal of denial on her mother's part & Sissy is determined to complete her objective. || Five Stars I really think Sissy is fine actress,so if you do too,then you make this purchase.Packaged well,quick delivery. || Three for one. Good, clean transfers. And how can you go wrong with three films on one disc? || Five Stars She's one of our favorite actresses, liked getting 3 movies on one disc even though they are slightly edited. || NO CC OR SUBTITLES. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE FILMS HAVE NO CC OR SUBTITLES.  THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN DESCRIPTION. IT IS USELESS TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED.  I NEED THE CC'S IN ORDER TO WATCH THE MOVIES. I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON OF THIS, BUT NOT SURE THEY HAVE RECEIVED MY INFORMATION. I AM UNABLE TO  RETURN IT. THIS DVD IS USELESS TO ME. NONE OF THE 3 FILMS HAVE CC'S AND/OR SUBTITLES. AMAZON PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU. || Four Stars Very good trio of films which showcase Miss Spacek's talents. Of the three, I enjoyed Raggedy Man the most. || Three Wonderful Spacek Films: All Presented In Widescreen SISSY SPACEK is a gifted actor. Though she has never been able to completey loose the Texas from her voice, she has completely inhabited her roles and become a myriad variety of women. She is always emotionally true, and never fails to bring heart and reality to her characterizations.<br /><br />RAGGEDY MAN followed right on the heels of her triumph in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER. Beautifully rendered by cast and crew, the film was a sleeper, and did not receive the audiences that it deserved. Directed by husband Jack Fisk, SPACEK and Eric Roberts win hearts as Nita and Teddy: two lonely people caught in circumstance by World War Two.<br /><br />More to follow. || Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses of all time I came on to Amazon today looking to just buy the movie Raggedy Man, as I already own The River.  I saw Raggedy Man recently, and loved it.  Sissy Spacek and Eric Roberts have great chemistry together.  I grew up watching The River and it is one of my all time favorite films.  Night Mother I saw recently, but I don't think I would ever like to own it.  Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft's acting were tops, but it was just such an emotional roller coaster for me, that I don't really care to see it again.  Very powerful.  (Just when you thought her mother changed her mind, you're wrong.  She had her mind made up a long time ago).\",\n          \"Sigh I soo much wanted to Really love this deck! I Really love the art work but as oracle cards it lacks. Since each card has the meaning printed on the back (left photo, &#34;Courage&#34;, right photo is the 'couragous' cat) a lot of the illustrations are too subtle, not reflecting the meaning enough or at all.<br />Also, I wish it allowed the reader to pick a card without seeing the cats (or the meanings), the only way to do so is close your eyes and pick one!<br />For a $20. Oracle deck with no booklet and a design that's pretty limited, I wish I bought a print or calendar of the cats instead. || Beautiful artwork! Even if you weren't interested on the lovely, uplifting messages on the back of each card... being able to take a break and immerse in the soft, warm, glow of the kitty art will renew your heart and soul. Enjoy! || Wrote review Already wrote review || Good art/ fun deck Adorable. Good card stock. Artwork is lovely. No need for interpretation, the cards' meanings are typed on the back. || I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn I wandered onto Amazon looking for a set of cards with cats and found this delightful set of 48 inspirational cards. The sample drawings were so intriguing, I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn. The explanation for each spirit cat is on the card which makes it easy to draw a card for inspiration and in the author's words, ignite intuition. Highly recommend. || I just love this deck! Super cute and charming. || Hmm. I love the art. Messages are a bit fluffy ... A very positive deck, I paid like $27 on kickstarter wish i would have waited. I draw with my 3 year old and she loves them, some stories/descriptions on the back of the card can almost be in a child's book. So choose wisely, if I didn't have a small child to enjoy these with I might not use them as often. I wish the messages were deeper it seems like they were an afterthought to the art. Maybe the messages could be more mature ? I'm just not in love with this deck how I thought I'd be. || Love these cards Great deck for cat lovers || Sweet deck with lovely whimsical art. There is something so light and sweet about this deck, it\\u2019s a softer energy. Really love the whimsical art. || Beautiful I couldn't be happier with these! They are beautiful and well made. Im new to Oracle and this is my first deck. Even if you arent into oracle, you could have fun with these! Looking forward to using these. || Wisdom with whimsy! This is a deeply inspiring deck, with such intense, yet whimsical art, and thoughtful messages to help direct anyone with questions about love, work, career and life in general. || Good art, fun cards These cards are a fun addition to a reading. The art is cute, but I don\\u2019t really get a good connection with them. || Cute They are cute. Short n sweet messages || I am calling it! This is my all time favorite Oracle deck I love absolutely everything about this deck. The pictures are so incredibly beautiful that they've inspired me to take up watercolor painting and flex my artistic muscles so to speak. I also love how each card has a tiny little story about the adorable kitten on the front that ends with an inspirational message on how that tiny story applies to you.<br /><br />I also wanted to let people know that there is no reference book for this deck, but in all honesty it's not necessary. The only reference you need is the message written on the inside of the box that says, &#34;Close your eyes, soften your body, and draw a card. Listen to the magical whisperings of your intuition.&#34; || A new favorite deck! I love this deck. The paintings are lovely, and the messages are spot on. || Beautiful cards all around. These cards are beautiful. The images are adorable, as well as the messages. || Beautiful artwork and wonderfully written cards. While these cards are certainly NOT a tarot or oracle deck, I've found that they can be used in a somewhat similar way if you are open to it. These cards have a calming, uplifting vibe to them that is similar to holding a purring cat on your lap. || Beautiful deck First off, I highly recommend this deck.  It's beautiful.  The paintings of cats are simply magical - from the more realistic ones in natural colors to the highly stylized, almost fairy-like ones in an array of soft pastels.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous.  No picture does them justice.  Soft pastels, earthy browns and a few striking black and white images with pops of  color.  The images are boarderless; the watercolor having a soft blend to it that makes the cards very dreamy looking.  There is no \\\"back\\\" to the cards.  One side has the image of the cat, the other side has a keyword, like \\\"Play\\\" and a paragraph starting with \\\"Meet...\\\" (I love the cat's names - everything from normal names like Luna and Golden, to charming titles like Miskin Rough-n-Tumble and Varo Tiptoe Sky) and a description of the meaning and energy of that cat.  There is no guidebook as that is technically *on* the cards themselves.  The meanings on the cards are insightful and encouraging.  This is a gentle deck.<br /><br />I'd been eyeing the cards for awhile, but been thrown by the image and meaning being on either side, no \\\"back\\\".  How do you shuffle and draw?  I eventually hit on the obvious: draw from the bottom.  These are great for a daily draw to get a feel for the energy of the day or as a closing to a tarot reading.  The artist's site also suggests using them as inspiration for art and writing projects and I think they could be used in a number of different ways.<br /><br />The cards themselves are square and have a satiny feel to them; and are quite large. || Love it love it Love it love it!! All illustrations are stunning and inspiring.  I am sure I'm gonna use the deck a lot\\ud83d\\udc96\\ud83d\\udc31 || Super beautiful! They are very beautiful and unique and I love the message on the cards. || Gorgeous inside out &lt;3 Heartwarming messages with supercute art.

All the artwork is beautiful and the explications are perfect, gives you enough information. They are just the right size for shuffling. || Worth every penny These cards are beautiful!<br /><br />The print quality is top notch, and the art is breathtaking. The little stories on the back are very cute and add a nuance to your daily draw. The card stock is sturdy but it could be a little better. || Artwork is beautiful These cards are so beautiful.  Cats are very whimsical.  Messages are spot on.  Got a deck for me and a friend.  We both love them. || Delightful Cards! These are just so beautiful, with very magical and whimsical illustrations.. I love the messages on the back of each card. These are more insight cards, rather than divination cards, but let's not quibble.. They can serve both purposes, if you are familiar with the use of oracle cards.. In any case, you can always draw inspiration and insight from them, while being delighted by their charming appeal! || Card stock quality is amazing art style is amazing highly recommend I can\\u2019t say enough of this Deck! This one doesn\\u2019t have a guide book but it doesn\\u2019t need one the writing is all in the back and it has very amazing description I love that all the kitties have names in the designated area of Domaine!

Every card has a beautiful picture of a cat, every back has the cats name and a description of the cat cards purpose. Very inspiring. I find these cards relate to my daily situations.

Sissy Spacek can hold her own among the best of the best.  I would have to say that Night Mother is my favorite.  Suicide is such a delicate subject but they brought it across w/o a hitch.  This is a true portrayal of denial on her mother's part & Sissy is determined to complete her objective. || Five Stars I really think Sissy is fine actress,so if you do too,then you make this purchase.Packaged well,quick delivery. || Three for one. Good, clean transfers. And how can you go wrong with three films on one disc? || Five Stars She's one of our favorite actresses, liked getting 3 movies on one disc even though they are slightly edited. || NO CC OR SUBTITLES. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE FILMS HAVE NO CC OR SUBTITLES.  THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN DESCRIPTION. IT IS USELESS TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED.  I NEED THE CC'S IN ORDER TO WATCH THE MOVIES. I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON OF THIS, BUT NOT SURE THEY HAVE RECEIVED MY INFORMATION. I AM UNABLE TO  RETURN IT. THIS DVD IS USELESS TO ME. NONE OF THE 3 FILMS HAVE CC'S AND/OR SUBTITLES. AMAZON PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU. || Four Stars Very good trio of films which showcase Miss Spacek's talents. Of the three, I enjoyed Raggedy Man the most. || Three Wonderful Spacek Films: All Presented In Widescreen SISSY SPACEK is a gifted actor. Though she has never been able to completey loose the Texas from her voice, she has completely inhabited her roles and become a myriad variety of women. She is always emotionally true, and never fails to bring heart and reality to her characterizations.<br /><br />RAGGEDY MAN followed right on the heels of her triumph in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER. Beautifully rendered by cast and crew, the film was a sleeper, and did not receive the audiences that it deserved. Directed by husband Jack Fisk, SPACEK and Eric Roberts win hearts as Nita and Teddy: two lonely people caught in circumstance by World War Two.<br /><br />More to follow. || Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses of all time I came on to Amazon today looking to just buy the movie Raggedy Man, as I already own The River.  I saw Raggedy Man recently, and loved it.  Sissy Spacek and Eric Roberts have great chemistry together.  I grew up watching The River and it is one of my all time favorite films.  Night Mother I saw recently, but I don't think I would ever like to own it.  Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft's acting were tops, but it was just such an emotional roller coaster for me, that I don't really care to see it again.  Very powerful.  (Just when you thought her mother changed her mind, you're wrong.  She had her mind made up a long time ago).\",\n          \"Sigh I soo much wanted to Really love this deck! I Really love the art work but as oracle cards it lacks. Since each card has the meaning printed on the back (left photo, &#34;Courage&#34;, right photo is the 'couragous' cat) a lot of the illustrations are too subtle, not reflecting the meaning enough or at all.<br />Also, I wish it allowed the reader to pick a card without seeing the cats (or the meanings), the only way to do so is close your eyes and pick one!<br />For a $20. Oracle deck with no booklet and a design that's pretty limited, I wish I bought a print or calendar of the cats instead. || Beautiful artwork! Even if you weren't interested on the lovely, uplifting messages on the back of each card... being able to take a break and immerse in the soft, warm, glow of the kitty art will renew your heart and soul. Enjoy! || Wrote review Already wrote review || Good art/ fun deck Adorable. Good card stock. Artwork is lovely. No need for interpretation, the cards' meanings are typed on the back. || I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn I wandered onto Amazon looking for a set of cards with cats and found this delightful set of 48 inspirational cards. The sample drawings were so intriguing, I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn. The explanation for each spirit cat is on the card which makes it easy to draw a card for inspiration and in the author's words, ignite intuition. Highly recommend. || I just love this deck! Super cute and charming. || Hmm. I love the art. Messages are a bit fluffy ... A very positive deck, I paid like $27 on kickstarter wish i would have waited. I draw with my 3 year old and she loves them, some stories/descriptions on the back of the card can almost be in a child's book. So choose wisely, if I didn't have a small child to enjoy these with I might not use them as often. I wish the messages were deeper it seems like they were an afterthought to the art. Maybe the messages could be more mature ? I'm just not in love with this deck how I thought I'd be. || Love these cards Great deck for cat lovers || Sweet deck with lovely whimsical art. There is something so light and sweet about this deck, it\\u2019s a softer energy. Really love the whimsical art. || Beautiful I couldn't be happier with these! They are beautiful and well made.

This is a deeply inspiring deck, with such intense, yet whimsical art, and thoughtful messages to help direct anyone with questions about love, work, career and life in general. || Good art, fun cards These cards are a fun addition to a reading. The art is cute, but I don\\u2019t really get a good connection with them. || Cute They are cute. Short n sweet messages || I am calling it! This is my all time favorite Oracle deck I love absolutely everything about this deck. The pictures are so incredibly beautiful that they've inspired me to take up watercolor painting and flex my artistic muscles so to speak. I also love how each card has a tiny little story about the adorable kitten on the front that ends with an inspirational message on how that tiny story applies to you.<br /><br />I also wanted to let people know that there is no reference book for this deck, but in all honesty it's not necessary. The only reference you need is the message written on the inside of the box that says, &#34;Close your eyes, soften your body, and draw a card. Listen to the magical whisperings of your intuition.&#34; || A new favorite deck! I love this deck. The paintings are lovely, and the messages are spot on. || Beautiful cards all around. These cards are beautiful. The images are adorable, as well as the messages. || Beautiful artwork and wonderfully written cards. While these cards are certainly NOT a tarot or oracle deck, I've found that they can be used in a somewhat similar way if you are open to it. These cards have a calming, uplifting vibe to them that is similar to holding a purring cat on your lap. || Beautiful deck First off, I highly recommend this deck.  It's beautiful.  The paintings of cats are simply magical - from the more realistic ones in natural colors to the highly stylized, almost fairy-like ones in an array of soft pastels.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous.  No picture does them justice.  Soft pastels, earthy browns and a few striking black and white images with pops of  color.  The images are boarderless; the watercolor having a soft blend to it that makes the cards very dreamy looking.  There is no \\\"back\\\" to the cards.  One side has the image of the cat, the other side has a keyword, like \\\"Play\\\" and a paragraph starting with \\\"Meet...\\\" (I love the cat's names - everything from normal names like Luna and Golden, to charming titles like Miskin Rough-n-Tumble and Varo Tiptoe Sky) and a description of the meaning and energy of that cat.  There is no guidebook as that is technically *on* the cards themselves.  The meanings on the cards are insightful and encouraging.  This is a gentle deck.<br /><br />I'd been eyeing the cards for awhile, but been thrown by the image and meaning being on either side, no \\\"back\\\".  How do you shuffle and draw?  I eventually hit on the obvious: draw from the bottom.  These are great for a daily draw to get a feel for the energy of the day or as a closing to a tarot reading.  The artist's site also suggests using them as inspiration for art and writing projects and I think they could be used in a number of different ways.<br /><br />The cards themselves are square and have a satiny feel to them; and are quite large. || Love it love it Love it love it!! All illustrations are stunning and inspiring.  I am sure I'm gonna use the deck a lot\\ud83d\\udc96\\ud83d\\udc31 || Super beautiful! They are very beautiful and unique and I love the message on the cards. || Gorgeous inside out &lt;3 Heartwarming messages with supercute art.

Cats are very whimsical.  Messages are spot on.  Got a deck for me and a friend.  We both love them. || Delightful Cards! These are just so beautiful, with very magical and whimsical illustrations.. I love the messages on the back of each card. These are more insight cards, rather than divination cards, but let's not quibble.. They can serve both purposes, if you are familiar with the use of oracle cards.. In any case, you can always draw inspiration and insight from them, while being delighted by their charming appeal! || Card stock quality is amazing art style is amazing highly recommend I can\\u2019t say enough of this Deck!

Every card has a beautiful picture of a cat, every back has the cats name and a description of the cat cards purpose. Very inspiring. I find these cards relate to my daily situations.

Since each card has the meaning printed on the back (left photo, &#34;Courage&#34;, right photo is the 'couragous' cat) a lot of the illustrations are too subtle, not reflecting the meaning enough or at all.<br />Also, I wish it allowed the reader to pick a card without seeing the cats (or the meanings), the only way to do so is close your eyes and pick one!<br />For a $20. Oracle deck with no booklet and a design that's pretty limited, I wish I bought a print or calendar of the cats instead. || Beautiful artwork! Even if you weren't interested on the lovely, uplifting messages on the back of each card... being able to take a break and immerse in the soft, warm, glow of the kitty art will renew your heart and soul. Enjoy! || Wrote review Already wrote review || Good art/ fun deck Adorable. Good card stock. Artwork is lovely. No need for interpretation, the cards' meanings are typed on the back. || I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn I wandered onto Amazon looking for a set of cards with cats and found this delightful set of 48 inspirational cards. The sample drawings were so intriguing, I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn. The explanation for each spirit cat is on the card which makes it easy to draw a card for inspiration and in the author's words, ignite intuition. Highly recommend. || I just love this deck! Super cute and charming. || Hmm. I love the art. Messages are a bit fluffy ... A very positive deck, I paid like $27 on kickstarter wish i would have waited. I draw with my 3 year old and she loves them, some stories/descriptions on the back of the card can almost be in a child's book. So choose wisely, if I didn't have a small child to enjoy these with I might not use them as often. I wish the messages were deeper it seems like they were an afterthought to the art. Maybe the messages could be more mature ? I'm just not in love with this deck how I thought I'd be. || Love these cards Great deck for cat lovers || Sweet deck with lovely whimsical art. There is something so light and sweet about this deck, it’s a softer energy. Really love the whimsical art. || Beautiful I couldn't be happier with these! They are beautiful and well made. Im new to Oracle and this is my first deck. Even if you arent into oracle, you could have fun with these! Looking forward to using these. || Wisdom with whimsy! This is a deeply inspiring deck, with such intense, yet whimsical art, and thoughtful messages to help direct anyone with questions about love, work, career and life in general. || Good art, fun cards These cards are a fun addition to a reading. The art is cute, but I don’t really get a good connection with them. || Cute They are cute. Short n sweet messages || I am calling it! This is my all time favorite Oracle deck I love absolutely everything about this deck. The pictures are so incredibly beautiful that they've inspired me to take up watercolor painting and flex my artistic muscles so to speak. I also love how each card has a tiny little story about the adorable kitten on the front that ends with an inspirational message on how that tiny story applies to you.<br /><br />I also wanted to let people know that there is no reference book for this deck, but in all honesty it's not necessary. The only reference you need is the message written on the inside of the box that says, &#34;Close your eyes, soften your body, and draw a card. Listen to the magical whisperings of your intuition.&#34; || A new favorite deck! I love this deck. The paintings are lovely, and the messages are spot on. || Beautiful cards all around. These cards are beautiful. The images are adorable, as well as the messages. || Beautiful artwork and wonderfully written cards. While these cards are certainly NOT a tarot or oracle deck, I've found that they can be used in a somewhat similar way if you are open to it. These cards have a calming, uplifting vibe to them that is similar to holding a purring cat on your lap. || Beautiful deck First off, I highly recommend this deck.  It's beautiful.  The paintings of cats are simply magical - from the more realistic ones in natural colors to the highly stylized, almost fairy-like ones in an array of soft pastels.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous.  No picture does them justice.  Soft pastels, earthy browns and a few striking black and white images with pops of  color.  The images are boarderless; the watercolor having a soft blend to it that makes the cards very dreamy looking.  There is no \"back\" to the cards.  One side has the image of the cat, the other side has a keyword, like \"Play\" and a paragraph starting with \"Meet...\" (I love the cat's names - everything from normal names like Luna and Golden, to charming titles like Miskin Rough-n-Tumble and Varo Tiptoe Sky) and a description of the meaning and energy of that cat.  There is no guidebook as that is technically *on* the cards themselves.  The meanings on the cards are insightful and encouraging.  This is a gentle deck.<br /><br />I'd been eyeing the cards for awhile, but been thrown by the image and meaning being on either side, no \"back\".  How do you shuffle and draw?  I eventually hit on the obvious: draw from the bottom.  These are great for a daily draw to get a feel for the energy of the day or as a closing to a tarot reading.  The artist's site also suggests using them as inspiration for art and writing projects and I think they could be used in a number of different ways.<br /><br />The cards themselves are square and have a satiny feel to them; and are quite large. || Love it love it Love it love it!! All illustrations are stunning and inspiring.  I am sure I'm gonna use the deck a lot💖🐱 || Super beautiful! They are very beautiful and unique and I love the message on the cards. || Gorgeous inside out &lt;3 Heartwarming messages with supercute art. A must for all cat lovers and soul searchers. || My favorite deck right now Love, love, love. I use these cards everyday, they are definitely one of my favorite decks. All the artwork is beautiful and the explications are perfect, gives you enough information. They are just the right size for shuffling. || Worth every penny These cards are beautiful!<br /><br />The print quality is top notch, and the art is breathtaking. The little stories on the back are very cute and add a nuance to your daily draw. The card stock is sturdy but it could be a little better. || Artwork is beautiful These cards are so beautiful.  Cats are very whimsical.  Messages are spot on.  Got a deck for me and a friend.  We both love them. || Delightful Cards! These are just so beautiful, with very magical and whimsical illustrations.. I love the messages on the back of each card. These are more insight cards, rather than divination cards, but let's not quibble.. They can serve both purposes, if you are familiar with the use of oracle cards.. In any case, you can always draw inspiration and insight from them, while being delighted by their charming appeal! || Card stock quality is amazing art style is amazing highly recommend I can’t say enough of this Deck! This one doesn’t have a guide book but it doesn’t need one the writing is all in the back and it has very amazing description I love that all the kitties have names in the designated area of Domaine! It makes you feel like they are really there once you get the card and read the message and overall very nice energy and amazing art style the card quality stock is amazing over all super satisfied and highly recommend || great cards!! these cards are very pretty, a good size & very nice to work with!! || so sweet! every card has a name and a story so sweet!  every card has a name and a story.  very uplifting || They are very peaceful, beautiful and colorful.  ❤️ I love this entire deck. I draw one every morning to meditate on as advice for the day or situations going on.  They are very peaceful and also positive ❤️ || Beautiful Love these cards they are beautiful and insightful! || Adorable So adorable! I love these cards.  The artwork is amazing. || Mixed feelings, artwork is beautiful though I wanted this as a daily card but somehow I can't connect with it. It's definitely me.  The messages don't give the sense of something.<br />The illustrations are static but beautiful. || Gorgeous artwork! Love Love Love this deck ! || 5 Star 5 stars. Every card has a beautiful picture of a cat, every back has the cats name and a description of the cat cards purpose. Very inspiring. I find these cards relate to my daily situations. Came in a beautiful box. Received them in time frame that was posted by seller. || A very cute deck to own and use I will recommend this deck to all both cat lovers & haters as the messages that come out of each card is meaningful and insightful and perhaps a bit magical as well. || Great artwork! Super cute! My daughter loves this deck too! || Unique and engaging. Lovely oracle deck! All of the artwork is engaging and the description of each is interesting.<br />The card stock is sturdy.<br />This was for a child and she loves it! || Best inspirational cards ever. I love these cards! They are beautifully designed. Their messages truly  inspirational. They are a little stiff and difficult to shuffle, but the more I use them, the more flexible they are becoming.

Spacek can turn any role into gold; unfortunately, her costars can't. || ... it once in a while just to remember the fun I had I was an extra in this movie so I watch it once in a while just to remember the fun I had. || Three for the price of 1 I 've seen 2 of the 3 films & loved them both.  Sissy Spacek can hold her own among the best of the best.  I would have to say that Night Mother is my favorite.  Suicide is such a delicate subject but they brought it across w/o a hitch.  This is a true portrayal of denial on her mother's part & Sissy is determined to complete her objective. || Five Stars I really think Sissy is fine actress,so if you do too,then you make this purchase.Packaged well,quick delivery. || Three for one. Good, clean transfers. And how can you go wrong with three films on one disc? || Five Stars She's one of our favorite actresses, liked getting 3 movies on one disc even though they are slightly edited. || NO CC OR SUBTITLES. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE FILMS HAVE NO CC OR SUBTITLES.  THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN DESCRIPTION. IT IS USELESS TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED.  I NEED THE CC'S IN ORDER TO WATCH THE MOVIES. I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON OF THIS, BUT NOT SURE THEY HAVE RECEIVED MY INFORMATION. I AM UNABLE TO  RETURN IT. THIS DVD IS USELESS TO ME. NONE OF THE 3 FILMS HAVE CC'S AND/OR SUBTITLES. AMAZON PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU. || Four Stars Very good trio of films which showcase Miss Spacek's talents. Of the three, I enjoyed Raggedy Man the most. || Three Wonderful Spacek Films: All Presented In Widescreen SISSY SPACEK is a gifted actor. Though she has never been able to completey loose the Texas from her voice, she has completely inhabited her roles and become a myriad variety of women. She is always emotionally true, and never fails to bring heart and reality to her characterizations.<br /><br />RAGGEDY MAN followed right on the heels of her triumph in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER. Beautifully rendered by cast and crew, the film was a sleeper, and did not receive the audiences that it deserved. Directed by husband Jack Fisk, SPACEK and Eric Roberts win hearts as Nita and Teddy: two lonely people caught in circumstance by World War Two.<br /><br />More to follow. || Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses of all time I came on to Amazon today looking to just buy the movie Raggedy Man, as I already own The River.  I saw Raggedy Man recently, and loved it.  Sissy Spacek and Eric Roberts have great chemistry together.  I grew up watching The River and it is one of my all time favorite films.  Night Mother I saw recently, but I don't think I would ever like to own it.  Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft's acting were tops, but it was just such an emotional roller coaster for me, that I don't really care to see it again.  Very powerful.  (Just when you thought her mother changed her mind, you're wrong.  She had her mind made up a long time ago).\n",

Spacek can turn any role into gold; unfortunately, her costars can't. || ... it once in a while just to remember the fun I had I was an extra in this movie so I watch it once in a while just to remember the fun I had. || Three for the price of 1 I 've seen 2 of the 3 films & loved them both.  Sissy Spacek can hold her own among the best of the best.  I would have to say that Night Mother is my favorite.  Suicide is such a delicate subject but they brought it across w/o a hitch.  This is a true portrayal of denial on her mother's part & Sissy is determined to complete her objective. || Five Stars I really think Sissy is fine actress,so if you do too,then you make this purchase.Packaged well,quick delivery. || Three for one. Good, clean transfers. And how can you go wrong with three films on one disc? || Five Stars She's one of our favorite actresses, liked getting 3 movies on one disc even though they are slightly edited. || NO CC OR SUBTITLES. PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THESE FILMS HAVE NO CC OR SUBTITLES.  THIS IS NOT SHOWN IN DESCRIPTION. IT IS USELESS TO THE HEARING IMPAIRED.  I NEED THE CC'S IN ORDER TO WATCH THE MOVIES. I HAVE TRIED TO INFORM AMAZON OF THIS, BUT NOT SURE THEY HAVE RECEIVED MY INFORMATION. I AM UNABLE TO  RETURN IT. THIS DVD IS USELESS TO ME. NONE OF THE 3 FILMS HAVE CC'S AND/OR SUBTITLES. AMAZON PLEASE HELP. THANK YOU. || Four Stars Very good trio of films which showcase Miss Spacek's talents. Of the three, I enjoyed Raggedy Man the most. || Three Wonderful Spacek Films: All Presented In Widescreen SISSY SPACEK is a gifted actor. Though she has never been able to completey loose the Texas from her voice, she has completely inhabited her roles and become a myriad variety of women. She is always emotionally true, and never fails to bring heart and reality to her characterizations.<br /><br />RAGGEDY MAN followed right on the heels of her triumph in COAL MINER'S DAUGHTER. Beautifully rendered by cast and crew, the film was a sleeper, and did not receive the audiences that it deserved. Directed by husband Jack Fisk, SPACEK and Eric Roberts win hearts as Nita and Teddy: two lonely people caught in circumstance by World War Two.<br /><br />More to follow. || Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses of all time I came on to Amazon today looking to just buy the movie Raggedy Man, as I already own The River.  I saw Raggedy Man recently, and loved it.  Sissy Spacek and Eric Roberts have great chemistry together.  I grew up watching The River and it is one of my all time favorite films.  Night Mother I saw recently, but I don't think I would ever like to own it.  Sissy Spacek and Anne Bancroft's acting were tops, but it was just such an emotional roller coaster for me, that I don't really care to see it again.  Very powerful.  (Just when you thought her mother changed her mind, you're wrong.  She had her mind made up a long time ago).\",\n          \"Sigh I soo much wanted to Really love this deck! I Really love the art work but as oracle cards it lacks. Since each card has the meaning printed on the back (left photo, &#34;Courage&#34;, right photo is the 'couragous' cat) a lot of the illustrations are too subtle, not reflecting the meaning enough or at all.<br />Also, I wish it allowed the reader to pick a card without seeing the cats (or the meanings), the only way to do so is close your eyes and pick one!<br />For a $20. Oracle deck with no booklet and a design that's pretty limited, I wish I bought a print or calendar of the cats instead. || Beautiful artwork! Even if you weren't interested on the lovely, uplifting messages on the back of each card... being able to take a break and immerse in the soft, warm, glow of the kitty art will renew your heart and soul. Enjoy! || Wrote review Already wrote review || Good art/ fun deck Adorable. Good card stock. Artwork is lovely. No need for interpretation, the cards' meanings are typed on the back. || I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn I wandered onto Amazon looking for a set of cards with cats and found this delightful set of 48 inspirational cards. The sample drawings were so intriguing, I ordered them and was not disappointed. The cards are well made and beautifully drawn. The explanation for each spirit cat is on the card which makes it easy to draw a card for inspiration and in the author's words, ignite intuition. Highly recommend. || I just love this deck! Super cute and charming. || Hmm. I love the art. Messages are a bit fluffy ... A very positive deck, I paid like $27 on kickstarter wish i would have waited. I draw with my 3 year old and she loves them, some stories/descriptions on the back of the card can almost be in a child's book. So choose wisely, if I didn't have a small child to enjoy these with I might not use them as often. I wish the messages were deeper it seems like they were an afterthought to the art. Maybe the messages could be more mature ? I'm just not in love with this deck how I thought I'd be. || Love these cards Great deck for cat lovers || Sweet deck with lovely whimsical art. There is something so light and sweet about this deck, it\\u2019s a softer energy. Really love the whimsical art. || Beautiful I couldn't be happier with these! They are beautiful and well made. Im new to Oracle and this is my first deck. Even if you arent into oracle, you could have fun with these! Looking forward to using these. || Wisdom with whimsy! This is a deeply inspiring deck, with such intense, yet whimsical art, and thoughtful messages to help direct anyone with questions about love, work, career and life in general. || Good art, fun cards These cards are a fun addition to a reading. The art is cute, but I don\\u2019t really get a good connection with them. || Cute They are cute. Short n sweet messages || I am calling it! This is my all time favorite Oracle deck I love absolutely everything about this deck. The pictures are so incredibly beautiful that they've inspired me to take up watercolor painting and flex my artistic muscles so to speak. I also love how each card has a tiny little story about the adorable kitten on the front that ends with an inspirational message on how that tiny story applies to you.<br /><br />I also wanted to let people know that there is no reference book for this deck, but in all honesty it's not necessary. The only reference you need is the message written on the inside of the box that says, &#34;Close your eyes, soften your body, and draw a card. Listen to the magical whisperings of your intuition.&#34; || A new favorite deck! I love this deck. The paintings are lovely, and the messages are spot on. || Beautiful cards all around. These cards are beautiful. The images are adorable, as well as the messages. || Beautiful artwork and wonderfully written cards. While these cards are certainly NOT a tarot or oracle deck, I've found that they can be used in a somewhat similar way if you are open to it. These cards have a calming, uplifting vibe to them that is similar to holding a purring cat on your lap. || Beautiful deck First off, I highly recommend this deck.  It's beautiful.  The paintings of cats are simply magical - from the more realistic ones in natural colors to the highly stylized, almost fairy-like ones in an array of soft pastels.<br /><br />The colors are gorgeous.  No picture does them justice.  Soft pastels, earthy browns and a few striking black and white images with pops of  color.  The images are boarderless; the watercolor having a soft blend to it that makes the cards very dreamy looking.  There is no \\\"back\\\" to the cards.  One side has the image of the cat, the other side has a keyword, like \\\"Play\\\" and a paragraph starting with \\\"Meet...\\\" (I love the cat's names - everything from normal names like Luna and Golden, to charming titles like Miskin Rough-n-Tumble and Varo Tiptoe Sky) and a description of the meaning and energy of that cat.  There is no guidebook as that is technically *on* the cards themselves.  The meanings on the cards are insightful and encouraging.  This is a gentle deck.<br /><br />I'd been eyeing the cards for awhile, but been thrown by the image and meaning being on either side, no \\\"back\\\".  How do you shuffle and draw?  I eventually hit on the obvious: draw from the bottom.  These are great for a daily draw to get a feel for the energy of the day or as a closing to a tarot reading.  The artist's site also suggests using them as inspiration for art and writing projects and I think they could be used in a number of different ways.<br /><br />The cards themselves are square and have a satiny feel to them; and are quite large. || Love it love it Love it love it!! All illustrations are stunning and inspiring.  I am sure I'm gonna use the deck a lot\\ud83d\\udc96\\ud83d\\udc31 || Super beautiful! They are very beautiful and unique and I love the message on the cards. || Gorgeous inside out &lt;3 Heartwarming messages with supercute art.

Cats are very whimsical.  Messages are spot on.  Got a deck for me and a friend.  We both love them. || Delightful Cards! These are just so beautiful, with very magical and whimsical illustrations.. I love the messages on the back of each card. These are more insight cards, rather than divination cards, but let's not quibble.. They can serve both purposes, if you are familiar with the use of oracle cards.. In any case, you can always draw inspiration and insight from them, while being delighted by their charming appeal! || Card stock quality is amazing art style is amazing highly recommend I can\\u2019t say enough of this Deck!

Every card has a beautiful picture of a cat, every back has the cats name and a description of the cat cards purpose. Very inspiring. I find these cards relate to my daily situations.

All of the artwork is engaging and the description of each is interesting.<br />The card stock is sturdy.<br />This was for a child and she loves it! || Best inspirational cards ever.

Highly recommend them.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"hierar_chunk\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"tensor([[-0.0873,  0.1029, -0.0079,  ..., -0.1104, -0.0378, -0.0404],\\n        [-0.0872,  0.1015, -0.0029,  ..., -0.1024, -0.0379, -0.0328],\\n        [ 0.0543,  0.2360,  0.0787,  ...,  0.0086,  0.0849,  0.0652],\\n        ...,\\n        [-0.0215,  0.0683,  0.0260,  ..., -0.0368, -0.0139, -0.0185],\\n        [-0.0012,  0.0387,  0.0612,  ..., -0.0242, -0.0115, -0.0128],\\n        [ 0.0033, -0.2046,  0.0645,  ..., -0.0269, -0.0298,  0.0907]],\\n       device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([[-0.0861,  0.0983, -0.0135,  ..., -0.1046, -0.0542, -0.0429],\\n        [-0.0661,  0.1004, -0.0106,  ..., -0.0992, -0.0584, -0.0290],\\n        [ 0.0206,  0.0982,  0.0174,  ..., -0.0613, -0.0154, -0.0208],\\n        ...,\\n        [-0.0026,  0.0026,  0.0047,  ..., -0.0118, -0.0037,  0.0028],\\n        [-0.0005, -0.0017,  0.0069,  ..., -0.0100, -0.0030,  0.0057],\\n        [ 0.0012, -0.0157, -0.0005,  ..., -0.0180, -0.0073,  0.0097]],\\n       device='cuda:0')\",\n          \"tensor([[-8.2321e-02,  1.0187e-01, -1.2598e-02,  ..., -9.7322e-02,\\n         -5.4718e-02, -3.2110e-02],\\n        [-7.8167e-02,  9.6929e-02, -3.6289e-03,  ..., -9.3204e-02,\\n         -5.8557e-02, -2.5354e-02],\\n        [-2.8189e-02,  1.3380e-01,  1.2562e-02,  ..., -1.2777e-01,\\n         -2.1487e-02,  1.0798e-02],\\n        ...,\\n        [ 5.7808e-05,  1.5407e-03,  4.6954e-04,  ..., -1.9958e-03,\\n         -1.3476e-03,  5.4558e-04],\\n        [ 7.6469e-04,  4.8566e-04,  1.7674e-03,  ..., -1.1772e-03,\\n         -1.4248e-03,  2.0802e-03],\\n        [ 1.6607e-03, -4.0918e-03,  8.0758e-04,  ..., -2.0998e-03,\\n         -1.6639e-03,  3.6822e-03]], device='cuda:0')\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
