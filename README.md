# GNN_recommender_system
Deep learning project to use GNN models to recommend items to customers 

# Structure of code 

- 00: set up related
- 01: Collaborative filering model
- 02: Baseline model  
- 03: Embedding experiments
- 04: Architecture experiments
- 05: Hyperparam tuning of models 
- 06: Final model
- 07: Generating plots

The folder utils has the necessary helper codes for the various notebooks.

# How to run 
1. Run the `00` coded notebooks to set up all the necessary files. Beyond that, the rest can be run in any order.
